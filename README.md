Presenting hspresent
====================

This is a simple program that lets you give powerpoint-like presentations in
your terminal (for certain definitions of powerpoint-like). It's extremely basic
and unintelligent. Don't expect much.

Compile and install using cabal:
    cabal build && cabal install

This will compile hspresent, and install an `hspresent` command line program.

There's a simple example presentation included, see `example.txt`.
